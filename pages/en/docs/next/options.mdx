# Quick Start

Umo Editor Next, in addition to including [all configurations](../options/default) of Umo Editor, has added or removed the following configurations:

## All Configurations
``` js
const defaultOptions = {
  // Configurations for Umo Editor
  // ...
  // Configurations for Umo Editor Next
  collaboration: {
    enabled: false,
    provider: {},
  },
}
```

## Unsupported Configurations

When online collaboration is enabled, the following configurations are not supported:

``` js
const defaultOptions = {
  document: {
    autoSave: {
      // ...
    },
  },
  onSave(){
    // ...
  }
}
```

In multi-user collaboration scenarios, document content is transmitted to the server in real time and can be directly stored in the database on the server side, eliminating the need for the client to initiate save requests.

## Configuration Details

### collaboration

Configuration related to multi-user collaborative editing. The implementation approach and principles can be referenced here: https://tiptap.dev/docs/hocuspocus.

- `collaboration.enabled`: Boolean, whether to enable online collaboration.
- `collaboration.provider`

**Description**: Configuration for online collaboration service providers. Umo Editor Next provides a default Node.js server based on [Express](https://expressjs.com/), which includes the Hocuspocus Server (see: [Umo Editor Next](../server)). This option supports all configurations of the Hocuspocus Server.

**Type**: Object

**Configuration**: The `url` should be set to the address of the Umo Editor Server provider, such as `ws://127.0.0.1:1235/provider`. You can also configure it for other providers. Other options follow the configuration of the Hocuspocus Server, see https://tiptap.dev/docs/hocuspocus/provider/configuration.
