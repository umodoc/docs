# Troubleshooting

## 1. Version entry is missing / panel is blank

Checklist:

- `collaboration.enabled` must be `true`
- `versions.enabled` must not be `false`
- Collaboration connection must be healthy (WebSocket reachable, token valid)

- [Collaboration](../collaboration)
- [Configuration](./options)

## 2. Saving a version says “No changes, cannot create a new version”

This avoids storing “no-op snapshots”.

Default behavior: if the current content is identical to the latest saved version, creating a new version is rejected.

Suggestions:

- Make a small change and save again
- Or allow “milestone-only versions” in your product (record milestones without requiring content changes)

## 3. Version preview fails / shows “Version content not found”

Possible reasons:

- The version did not finish saving (the record exists, but the preview payload was not persisted or is unreadable)
- Server storage was cleaned or migrated incompletely, causing old previews to be missing
- Document identifiers mismatch, so the server can’t find the preview data for that version

How to narrow down:

- Confirm the version exists in the version list (you can see version number and name)
- In the Network/WebSocket panel, check whether `action: 'version.preview'` receives a corresponding `event: 'version.preview'` response

## 4. “Important” label does not show / toggle does not work

Checklist:

- Confirm you used “Mark as Important / Unmark as Important” in the version item’s “More” menu
- Confirm collaboration is connected (actions won’t sync while offline)
- If you render your own list: ensure your version list data includes the `important` field
