# Introduction

Document version history helps teams save a document state as a “version” during collaborative editing, and provides a version list, version preview, version comparison, and restore (rollback).

You can think of it as: adding “named milestones + restorable time points” to a collaborative document.

## Prerequisites

Version history relies on collaboration. Make sure you have:

- Collaboration enabled: [Collaboration](../collaboration)
- Server deployed and configured: [Umo Editor Server](../../server)

## What you can do

- Create versions manually (save the current document as a named version)
- Preview a version (view the content without affecting the current document)
- Compare versions (compare the differences between two versions)
- Restore to a version (restore the document and sync the change to collaborators)
- View version metadata (creator, created time, etc.)
- Mark important versions (mark key versions as “Important” for quick scanning)

## How to use it

Version history is mainly used through:

- Configuration: enable/tune it via `options.versions` (see [Configuration](./options))
- Methods: call exposed methods to manage versions from outside the editor (see [Configuration & Methods](./options))
- UI: use the built-in “Version History” panel to create/preview/compare/restore (see [Getting Started](./getting-started))

## What is an “Important” version

An “Important” version is used to mark milestones (for example: stage acceptance, release checkpoints, or handoff points):

- The version list shows an “Important” label for quick identification
- You can toggle “Mark as Important / Unmark as Important” from the version item’s “More” menu
