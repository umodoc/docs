# Getting Started

This page shows the shortest path: enable collaboration → enable versions → create a version → preview/compare → restore.

## 1. Enable collaboration and server

Version history relies on collaboration.

- Server: deploy and start Umo Editor Server. See [Umo Editor Server](../../server).
- Client: enable collaboration options. See [Collaboration](../collaboration).

## 2. Enable versions

```js
const options = {
  collaboration: {
    enabled: true,
    // ...
  },
  versions: {
    enabled: true,
  },
}
```

## 3. Open the Version History panel

In the editor UI, open the “Version History” panel (the entry is usually in the toolbar or the “Start” menu).

Common areas in the panel:

- Version list: shows all saved versions
- Actions: create versions, enter compare mode, restore, etc.

## 4. Create a version

In the panel, click “Create version / Save version”, enter a version name, and save.

Recommended naming format: “stage + date time”, for example: `Acceptance 02-15 10:30`.

## 5. Preview and compare

Click a version in the list to preview it (usually shown as a diff against the previous version). If there is only one version, it only shows the content without a diff.

If your document has comments enabled, you can ignore non-content differences during comparison (see [Configuration](./options)).

```js
const options = {
  versions: {
    enabled: true,
    diffIgnoreMarks: ['inlineThread'],
    diffIgnoreAttributes: ['id', 'data-thread-id'],
  },
}
```

## 6. Restore

Select the target version in the panel and click “Restore”.

After a successful restore:

- The current document content switches to the target version
- The change is synced to collaborators
- Two new records are added: a backup before restore and the record after restore

## 7. Mark an important version

In the version list, click “More” on the target version:

- Choose “Mark as Important”: the version shows an “Important” label
- Choose “Unmark as Important” again: removes the label

This is useful for milestones such as acceptance, release checkpoints, or sharing/handoff points.
