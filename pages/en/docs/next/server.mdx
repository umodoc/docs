# Server Configuration

Umo Editor Next uses the [Umo Editor Server](../server) as the default backend service. You can deploy your own server to provide the required services, or simply use the official Umo Editor Server.

It is recommended to proxy the Umo Editor Server through a gateway or other backend application. This allows you to intercept and process requests, enhancing the security and robustness of the Umo Editor Server.

The Umo Editor Server is designed to extend the capabilities of Umo Editor Next. To ensure these enhanced features work properly, please configure the following options correctly.

## Default Configuration

```js
const defaultOptions = {
  // Server-related configuration, Added in v7.1.0
  server: {
    host: '',
    ssl: false,
    token: '',
  },
}
```
