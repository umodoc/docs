# Annotation

The annotation feature lets you make temporary visual marks on document pages—freehand annotation, underlines, shape selection, and erasing. It is useful for explanations, reviews, and collaborative discussions. Annotation can also be used in presentation mode for live demos.

## Features

- Document annotation: zoomable, serializable, undo/redo supported
- Multiple tools: freehand pen, straight line, rectangle, circle, eraser
- Color & stroke width: supports adjusting pen color and stroke width
- Collaboration sync: in collaboration mode, the canvas content syncs in real time, including the current annotator info
- Edit protection: when someone enables annotation during collaboration, other clients are notified and switched to read-only to avoid conflicts

## Usage

### Entry

- The floating button (pen icon) at the bottom-right of the page toggles annotation mode on/off.
- When enabled, an annotation toolbar appears for selecting tools, adjusting color/size, undo/redo, clearing the canvas, and closing.

### Toolbar

- Undo / Redo: revert or restore annotation operations
- Color: set pen color
- Tool: choose the annotation tool (freehand/line/rectangle/circle/eraser)
- Size: adjust stroke width
- Clear: clear the current canvas
- Close: exit annotation mode

### Works in Presentation Mode

When presentation mode is enabled, the editor typically becomes read-only to prevent accidental edits, but the annotation layer remains available:

- You can use annotation during presentations to explain content
- Close annotation mode when finished

## Collaboration Mode

When collaboration is enabled:

- The canvas content syncs in real time across clients
- The current annotator info syncs and is displayed in the toolbar
- When any collaborator enables annotation mode, other collaborators are notified and the editor switches to read-only
- When annotation mode is closed, editing capability is restored (if not currently in presentation mode and the document itself is not read-only)

## Default Configuration

```js
const defaultOptions = {
  annotation: {
    enabled: true,
    defaultColor: '#ff4d4f',
