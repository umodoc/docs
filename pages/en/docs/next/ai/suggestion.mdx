# AI Suggestion

AI Suggestion is a context-aware intelligent suggestion feature that predicts and generates subsequent content in real time as users type.
Based on the current text and cursor position, it provides continuous writing, smart suggestions, or code suggestion options, helping users reduce repetitive input and improve editing efficiency and writing fluency.

AI Suggestion is commonly used in scenarios such as AI writing, intelligent suggestions, code suggestion, and text enhancement. Currently, AI Suggestion is only available for text-based nodes.

This feature supports single or multiple suggestion suggestions. Users can press the Tab key to quickly accept a suggestion. When multiple candidate suggestions are available, users can use the Up and Down arrow keys to switch between suggestion items.
