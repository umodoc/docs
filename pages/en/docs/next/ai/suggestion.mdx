# AI Suggestions

AI Suggestions is a context-aware hinting feature that predicts and generates subsequent content while the user types. Based on the current text and cursor position, it provides continuations and completions to reduce repetitive input and improve editing efficiency and writing flow.

It can be used for AI writing, smart hints, code completion, and text enhancement. Currently, AI Suggestions only applies to text-type nodes.

It supports single or multiple completion candidates. Users can accept with Tab. When multiple candidates are available, use the up/down arrow keys to switch between them.
