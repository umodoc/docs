# Getting Started

As a commercial software, Umo Editor Next is no longer distributed as a public NPM package. After obtaining a [commercial license](./buy), you can find the packaged code in our private repository and add Umo Editor Next to your project using the following methods.

## Using the Official Packaged Code

### 1. Copy the Packaged Code

Copy the latest packaged file from the `/releases` directory in the official private repository to your local machine. Assume the local path relative to your project is `./umo-editor-next-xxx.tgz`.

### 2. Install Umo Editor Next

Run the following command in your project to install the downloaded packaged file. Make sure to specify the correct file path.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install --save ./umo-editor-next-xxx.tgz
```

### 3. All Set

With the above steps, you have successfully installed the Umo Editor Next NPM dependency and can now use it in your project.

## Building It Yourself

You can also build the package yourself by following these steps:

### 1. Clone the Official Repository

```bash
git clone <Umo Editor Next official private repository URL>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies and Build the Project Code

```sh npm2yarn
npm install
npm build
```

### 3. Install Umo Editor Next

Assume the local repository path you cloned is relative to your project as `../umo-editor-next`.

Run the following command in your project to install Umo Editor Next:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install --save ../umo-editor-next/releases/umo-editor-next-xxx.tgz
```

### 4. All Set

With the above steps, you have successfully installed the Umo Editor Next NPM dependency and can now use it in your project.
