# File Upload Configuration

This section is used to configure file upload settings, including allowed file types and file size limits. For methods of file uploading and file deletion, please refer to the [Methods](/en/docs/events) section.

## Default Configuration

```js
{
  file: {
    allowedMimeTypes: [],
    maxSize: 1024 * 1024 * 100, // 100MB
  },
}
```

## Configuration Item Descriptions

### file.allowedMimeTypes
