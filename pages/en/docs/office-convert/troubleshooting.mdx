# Troubleshooting

## Conversion failure (500)

- Symptom: error message like `Document conversion failed: ...`.
- Checks:
  - Verify the format is supported (ensure the extension matches the MIME type).
  - Check disk permissions and whether directories exist (`UPLOAD_DIR` / `CONVERTED_DIR`).
  - Check logs and correlate with `X-Task-Id`.

## Database connection error / table initialization failure

- Symptom: startup logs show errors like table creation failures.
- Checks:
  - Verify `DB_HOST/DB_PORT/DB_USER/DB_PASSWORD/DB_NAME`.
  - Ensure the MySQL service is running and reachable.
  - Try creating the database and granting privileges manually.

## Downloading original file fails

- Symptom: `404 File not found`, or remote URL download returns a non-200 status.
- Checks:
  - Verify the local file path is correct; the file may have been cleaned up or not saved (for example, if `UPLOAD_DIR` is not set, uploads may not be persisted).
  - Verify the remote URL is reachable and does not require authentication.

## Cache hit but content is unexpected

- Symptom: `X-From-Cache: true`, but the output does not match expectations.
- Checks:
  - Verify `FILE_HASH_ALGORITHM` and ensure hash computation is stable.
  - If you have cases where the content changes but the hash key does not, consider adding a secondary validation (such as timestamps or metadata).

## Large files and performance issues

- Symptom: conversions are slow or the service becomes unresponsive.
- Checks:
  - Adjust `MAX_FILE_SIZE` and concurrency; consider queue-based processing.
  - Upgrade CPU/memory; consider object storage and CDN.

## Webhook not received

- Symptom: your business system does not receive callbacks.
- Checks:
  - Verify `CONVERTED_WEBHOOK_URL` and network reachability.
  - Check firewall, proxy, and routing rules.

## Port already in use

- Symptom: service fails to start due to a port conflict.
- Checks: change `PORT` or stop the conflicting process (PM2/other services).

## Version and dependency issues

- Recommendation: regularly update Node.js and NPM dependencies to improve security and compatibility.
