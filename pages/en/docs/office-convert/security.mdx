# Security & Compliance

## Goals

Keep the document conversion service safe and controllable across upload, conversion, and download stages, to protect the system and user data.

## Input Safety

- Upload file size limit: `MAX_FILE_SIZE` (MB) to prevent resource abuse.
- Path and URL validation:
  - Prevent directory traversal (only allow controlled paths within the service).
  - When downloading remote files, validate `http/https` and restrict trusted sources to reduce SSRF risk.
  - URL-decode and re-validate parameters such as `filename` and `url`.

## Data Safety

- File hash caching: reduce repeated conversions and resource consumption.
- Directory isolation: separate `uploads` and `converted` directories, and optionally partition by date.
- Logging: avoid logging sensitive values (such as database passwords).

## Transport

- Prefer HTTPS, especially in production and for webhook callbacks.
- Add security headers (such as `X-Content-Type-Options` and `X-Frame-Options`) at a reverse proxy layer (for example, Nginx).

## Rate Limiting and Concurrency

- Add rate limiting at the gateway/proxy layer (by IP/user).
- Consider queueing and concurrency control for large file conversions to reduce peak risk.

## Webhook Security

- Use HTTPS callback URLs.
- Add request signing (for example, HMAC-SHA256) and include `X-Signature` in headers.
- Implement replay protection on the receiver side (use `taskId` for idempotency).

## Dependency Security

- Regularly update NPM dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Mount font/resource directories as read-only where possible.

## Logging and Auditing

- Use `LOG_DIR` to aggregate logs and record key events (uncaught exceptions, denied access, etc.).
- Follow data minimization and auditability principles to meet enterprise security requirements.
