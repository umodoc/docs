# Security & Compliance

## Access Control

- Use `WHITE_LIST` to restrict allowed origins (CORS).
- Place the service behind a gateway for authentication/authorization.

## Input Safety

- Limit upload size via `MAX_FILE_SIZE`.
- Validate file extension and MIME types.
- For URL-based conversion, restrict schemes to `http/https` and validate sources to reduce SSRF risk.

## Data Safety

- Keep uploads and converted outputs in separate directories.
- Avoid logging sensitive configuration values such as database passwords.

## Transport

- Use HTTPS in production.

## Webhook Security

- Prefer HTTPS.
- Consider signing requests (HMAC) and implement replay protection on the receiver side.
