# Environment Variable Configuration

The `.env` file is mainly used to configure the application runtime environment and parameters. It separates configuration from code and makes deployment management for different environments (development/test/production) easier. You can adjust application behavior by editing the configuration file without changing source code, improving deployment flexibility and security.

Copy the `.env.example` file in the root directory, rename it to `.env`, place it in the project root directory, and modify the values as needed.

## Configuration Items

For a complete `.env` example, see `.env.example`. Below is a detailed explanation of each configuration item.

### Node Environment

```bash
# node environment
NODE_ENV = production
```

### Service Configuration

```bash
PORT = 1236
SERVER_NAME = Umo Office Convert
```

### Logging Configuration

```bash
LOG_DIR = ./logs
```

### File Upload Configuration

```bash
# Maximum allowed upload size in MB
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 50
```

### Document Storage Path Configuration

```bash
UPLOAD_DIR = ./uploads/[year]/[month]
CONVERTED_DIR = ./converted/[year]/[month]
```

### File Hash Algorithm Configuration

```bash
FILE_HASH_ALGORITHM = sha256
```

### MySQL Database Configuration

```bash
DB_HOST = localhost
DB_PORT = 3306
DB_USER = root
DB_PASSWORD =
DB_NAME = umo_office_convert
DB_TABLE_CONVERT_TASKS = convert_tasks
```

### Webhook Configuration

```bash
CONVERTED_WEBHOOK_URL =
```

## Important Notes

### Path Variable Notes

- `[year]`, `[month]`, and `[day]` are dynamic path variables. The system will automatically replace them based on the current date. For example, `./uploads/[year]/[month]` may generate a path like `./uploads/2024/01`.
- If an upload directory is not specified, uploaded files will not be saved.

### Security Notes

1. **Database password**: set `DB_PASSWORD` according to your environment.
2. **File size limit**: adjust `MAX_FILE_SIZE` according to your needs to avoid exhausting server resources.

### Hash Algorithm Selection

- The file hash algorithm is used to generate a unique identifier for a file. The supported algorithm list varies depending on your Node.js version, operating system, and OpenSSL version. Common algorithms include `md5`, `sha1`, `sha256`, and `sha512`.
- If you change the hash algorithm, ensure the length of the `hash` field in the database table is sufficient to store the hash value.

### Webhook Functionality

- `CONVERTED_WEBHOOK_URL` is used to receive file processing status notifications. The configured URL should accept `POST` requests without authorization.
- When a file is uploaded or a file conversion is completed, the system will send a POST request to the configured Webhook URL, containing information related to the conversion task.
- Leaving it empty or not configuring it means the Webhook feature is not enabled.
