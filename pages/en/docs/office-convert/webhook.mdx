# Webhook

After a file is uploaded or converted, the service can send notifications to a configured webhook URL. This helps your business system receive events and trigger follow-up workflows. Enable it via the `CONVERTED_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable.

## Trigger Points

- Send one notification after an upload succeeds.
- Send one notification after a conversion succeeds.
- If a cached result is returned (same file hash), it will also send a notification (`fromCache=true`).

## Request

- Method: `POST`
- Header: `Content-Type: application/json`
- Destination: `CONVERTED_WEBHOOK_URL`

## Payload Example

```json
{
  "taskId": "bccbff66-fa2c-4d6d-bc30-a7c34ca0181b",
  "type": "uploaded",
  "fromCache": false,
  "file": {
    "filename": "document.docx",
    "mime": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document",
    "size": 90239,
    "path": "/uploads/2024/10/bccbff66-fa2c-4d6d-bc30-a7c34ca0181b.docx"
  }
}
```

Field descriptions:

- `taskId`: conversion task ID, used for downloading the original/converted file later.
- `type`: event type. Possible values: `uploaded`, `converted`.
- `fromCache`: whether the result is returned from cache.
- `file`: file metadata.

## Security Recommendations

- Use HTTPS webhook URLs.

## Work with Download APIs

- After receiving a webhook callback, your business system can use `GET /convert/{taskId}` to download the file.
