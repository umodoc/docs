# Basic Introduction

Umo Editor is developed based on the [Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/) headless editor, supporting enhancement of functionality and user experience through [official extensions](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/extensions), [third-party extensions](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=tiptap%20extension), and [custom extensions](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/guide/custom-extensions).

## UI Instruction

From version 3.0 onwards, Umo Editor has made some UI-related components available; see the [Components](./components). In addition to the provided components, to maintain UI consistency, you can use the [CSS variables](../docs/themes#css-variables) offered by Umo Editor in your UI. You can also fork the code for your own development or [contact us](../docs#contact-us) for custom development.
