# Basic Introduction

Umo Editor is developed based on the [Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/) headless editor, supporting enhancement of functionality and user experience through [official extensions](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/extensions), [third-party extensions](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=tiptap%20extension), and [custom extensions](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/guide/custom-extensions).

## UI Instruction

Currently, Umo Editor only exposes a subset of UI-related features, such as [popup components](../docs/popup). The UI parts involved with the used extensions need to be implemented by yourself. To maintain UI consistency, you can utilize the [CSS Variables](../docs/theme#css-variables) provided by Umo Editor. Other UI-related content will be gradually opened in subsequent versions. You can also pull the code for self-development or [contact us](../docs#contact-us) for [custom development](../docs#custom-development).

## Built-in Extensions List
