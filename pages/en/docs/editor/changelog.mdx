## 🎉  Version 5.0.0 <Badge>February 8, 2025</Badge>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="❗">
Thank you for your continued support of Umo Editor. After careful consideration and facing many challenges, we have decided that v4.6 will be the final version to support pagination. Starting with v5.0, pagination support will be temporarily discontinued, but it may return in the future.

If you still need pagination, you can continue using the v4.x versions, but these versions will no longer be maintained. Alternatively, you can fork the code and modify it yourself. The branch supporting pagination is available at: [page-break-v4](https://github.com/umodoc/editor/tree/page-break-v4).
