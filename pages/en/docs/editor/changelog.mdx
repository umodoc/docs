# Changelog

Umo Editor Next's changelog can be found at: https://dev.umodoc.com/en/docs/next/changelog

## 🎉 v10.0.0 <Badge>2026-02-10</Badge>

<Callout type="info" emoji="❗">
This update is a **milestone major upgrade**. Without breaking existing configurations or usage patterns, Umo Editor’s core codebase has been smoothly migrated to the **latest Tiptap v3**, and all extensions have been upgraded to the latest v3 versions. At the same time, we removed all references to Pro extensions and performed a systematic refactor of the overall codebase.
  
This upgrade not only significantly **reduces bundle size** and **improves loading and editing performance for large documents**, but also lays a more solid foundation for future feature expansion and long-term maintenance. **We strongly recommend all users upgrade.**

Note: If you are upgrading to v10, the synchronized `cdnUrl` configuration that references [`@umoteam/editor-external`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@umoteam/editor-external) CDN resources must also be upgraded to v10.

## 🎉 Version 5.0.0 <Badge>February 8, 2025</Badge>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="❗">
  Thank you for your continued support of Umo Editor. After careful
  consideration and facing many challenges, we have decided that v4.6 will be
  the final version to support pagination. Starting with v5.0, pagination
  support will be temporarily discontinued, but it may return in the future. The
  good news is that the Tiptap official team has noticed the community's urgent
  need for a pagination feature and has already started development. However,
  there is no clear release date yet. See:
  https://x.com/tiptap_editor/status/1812154617733538288. If you still need
  pagination, you can continue using the v4.x versions, but these versions will
  no longer be maintained. Alternatively, you can fork the code and modify it
  yourself. The branch supporting pagination is available at:
  [page-break-v4](https://github.com/umodoc/editor/tree/page-break-v4).
</Callout>

1. ⚠️ Completely removed support for pagination.
