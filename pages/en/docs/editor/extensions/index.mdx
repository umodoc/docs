# Introduction

Umo Editor is developed based on the [Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/) headless editor and supports enhancing functionality and user experience through [official extensions](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/extensions), [third-party extensions](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=tiptap%20extension), and [custom extensions](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/guide/custom-extensions).

## UI-Related Notes

Starting from v3.0, Umo Editor has opened up some UI-related components. See [Components](./components). In addition to the open components, to maintain UI consistency, you can use the [CSS variables](../options/theme#css-variables) provided by Umo Editor in your UI. You can also pull the code to develop it yourself or [contact us](../../#contact-us) for [custom development](../../customization).
