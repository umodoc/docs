# Introduction

To maintain a consistent user experience and reduce development workload, starting from version 3.0, Umo Editor provides a set of components. These components include the following:

- [UmoMenuButton](./menu-button)
- [UmoDialog](./dialog)
- [UmoTooltip](./tooltip)

These components are developed or re-wrapped based on some components from [TDesign Vue Next](https://tdesign.tencent.com/vue-next/overview-en). Therefore, in most cases, they share the same configuration and usage.
