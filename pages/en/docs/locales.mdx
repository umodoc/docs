# Multi-language Support

Umo Editor has built-in support for Simplified Chinese and English. If you need support for other languages, you will need to modify and compile the code yourself.

## How to Extend Languages

Umo Editor supports Simplified Chinese and English by default. If you need to extend languages, you can refer to the Simplified Chinese and English language packs and configurations to modify and compile the code yourself.

## How to Contribute Language Packs

The development of Umo Editor relies on community support. You can submit a PR to contribute language packs in the [Umo Editor repository](https://github.com/umodoc/editor).
