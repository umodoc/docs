Please check the following:

1. Does the parent element of `<umo-editor />` have a height, or is there a style `overflow: hidden`;
2. Check if the browser is supported, see [Browser Support](/en/docs/#browser-support);
3. Right-click to inspect the element and check if the DOM node of Umo Editor is loaded;
4. Check the browser's Console panel for any error messages;
5. Verify that the `cdnUrl` configuration for `<umo-editor />` is correct and that the `cdnUrl` is accessible.

<FAQBox title="The interface is displayed incorrectly, and some styles are missing?">
In order to reduce the size of the Umo Editor core package and improve loading speed, Umo Editor uses a CDN to introduce some static resources through configuration, which include third-party modules, images, icon resources, etc.

Since Umo Editor uses [Unpkg](https://unpkg.com) as the default CDN, but Unpkg may be slow or inaccessible in some regions, you can modify the CDN through [CDN Configuration - Using Local Resources](../options/cdn#using-local-resources) to improve loading speed.
