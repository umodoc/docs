# Deployment with Docker

Umo Editor Server provides Docker images (located in `docker/`), allowing you to deploy Umo Editor Server using Docker. You can modify the `Dockerfile` in the project root directory according to your specific requirements.

Deploying with Docker simplifies the deployment process and is particularly suitable for **internal network deployment** scenarios.

Below are the steps for deploying with Docker. Before proceeding, you need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and log in.

## 1. Deploying with the Official Docker Image

This approach is suitable when you haven't modified the source code (including the `Dockerfile`).

### 1) Load the Latest Docker Image

```bash
# Execute in the project root directory
docker load -i ./docker/umo-editor-server.tar
```
### 2) Start the Container

```bash
# Execute in the project root directory
docker run -d --name umo-editor-server -p 1235:1235 umo-editor-server:latest
```

### 3) Verify Container Status

```bash
# Check the container running status
docker ps | grep umo-editor-server
```

### 4) Access Umo Editor Server

Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:1235` to verify that the service is running properly.

## 2. Custom Deployment

This approach is necessary when you've modified the source code (including the `Dockerfile`). Follow these steps for custom deployment.

### 1) Build a Custom Docker Image

```sh npm2yarn
npm run build:docker
```

The built Docker image will be located at `docker/umo-editor-server:latest`. You can then use this image to deploy on your local machine or server.

### 2) Next Steps

Refer to the steps in [1. Deploying with the Official Docker Image](#1-deploying-with-the-official-docker-image).
