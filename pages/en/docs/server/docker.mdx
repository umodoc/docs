# Deploying with Docker

Umo Editor Server provides Docker images (located in the `docker/` directory) for easy deployment. You can deploy Umo Editor Server using Docker and modify the `Dockerfile` in the project root directory according to your specific requirements.

Docker deployment simplifies the installation process and is especially suitable for **internal network deployments**.

## 1. Prerequisites

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and log in.

## 2. Build the Docker Image

```sh npm2yarn
npm run build:docker
```

The built Docker image will be available at `docker/umo-editor-server:latest`. You can use this image for deployment on your local machine or server.

## 3. Load the Docker Image

```bash
# Execute in the project root directory
docker load -i ./docker/umo-editor-server.tar
```

## 4. Start the Container

```bash
# Execute in the project root directory
docker run -d --name umo-editor-server -p 1235:1235 umo-editor-server:latest
```

## 5. Verify Container Status

```bash
# Check the container running status
docker ps | grep umo-editor-server
```

## 6. Access Umo Editor Server

Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:1235` to verify that the service is running properly.
