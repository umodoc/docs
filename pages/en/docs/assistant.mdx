# AI Document Assistant

The AI Document Assistant is an efficiency tool integrated with artificial intelligence technology, primarily designed to enhance the efficiency of document creation.

The AI Document Assistant passes the content selected by the user and the input instructions to the AI model. The AI model, based on this information, generates document content that meets the requirements and returns the results to the AI Document Assistant.

## Technical Principles

### Process Description
1. The user sends a command to the AI Document Assistant, specifying the action they wish to perform.
2. The AI Document Assistant then invokes a method named `onAssistant`.
3. The `onAssistant` method calls the AI model via HTTP or other means.
4. The AI model processes the request and then returns and displays the result.
5. The `onAssistant` method returns the result in a readable stream or text format to the AI Document Assistant.
6. The user selects the results returned by the AI Document Assistant.
