# Basic Introduction

To maintain a consistent user experience and reduce development workload, starting from version v3.0, Umo Editor provides a set of components externally. These components include the following:

- [UmoMenuButton](./components/menu-button)
- [UmoDialog](./components/dialog)
- [UmoTooltip](./components/tooltip)

These components are developed or wrapped based on some components from [TDesign Vue Next](https://tdesign.tencent.com/vue-next/overview-en), so in most cases, they have the same configuration and usage.

## Example
