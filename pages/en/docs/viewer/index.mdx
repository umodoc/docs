# Introduction

> Note: Starting from version v1.0.0, Umo Viewer no longer supports PDF document preview.

Umo Viewer is a document viewer for previewing Umo Editor documents. It was created to solve the preview problem of [Umo Editor](https://github.com/umodoc/editor) documents. In most non-editing scenarios, only the document content needs to be displayed without loading the entire editor to improve loading speed. Umo Viewer can seamlessly integrate with [Umo Editor](https://github.com/umodoc/editor) documents and maintain good compatibility.

[Umo Editor](https://github.com/umodoc/editor) is a localized open-source document editor based on Vue3 and Tiptap3. It provides powerful document editing capabilities, AI creation features, and supports pagination, Markdown syntax, rich text editing, and much more.
